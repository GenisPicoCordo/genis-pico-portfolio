This is Genís Picó Portfolio

In my portfolio I'm using #ReactJS with best practices, file, and folder structure. Also I'm using SCSS, #Animations, using the most
popular animation library - Framer Motion. And #Sanity. Sanity will allow us to dynamically manage the content of the entire application.

 Sanity.io is the platform for structured content. It allows you to manage text, images, and other data using APIs.
